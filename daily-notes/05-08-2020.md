This set of notes is really to serve as a template for notes going forward. Notes will be taken freeform, and mainly focus on tracking what I'm doing on a given day, any ideas I have pertaining to that work (or other work), and any results or links to work done (this can include experiments, code, pictures, plots, anything). In doing this loosely, the hope is that I can continue to do efficient, useful, and great research in the style proposed in [this post](http://joschu.net/blog/opinionated-guide-ml-research.html).
